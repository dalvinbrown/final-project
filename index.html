          Bruce Bolis is alarmed by how many strangers come in and out of his building during the stay-at-home era.

          The Flatbush, Brooklyn resident said his neighbors across the hall are largely to blame. 

“I don’t know what they’re doing in here, but I hear them buzzing people in all the time,” Alexander, a former retail worker, said. On one Saturday in April, they threw a party of some sort, which was “bizarre” because the city is still on lock down orders.

        <p class="g-copy">
          Not knowing what else to do, Alexander called 311. 

          “I had to report it.” Alexander said. “We have older people in the building. We have kids in the building. With coronavirus spreading around, they shouldn’t have had that many people in here.”

          New York is the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the US, and some residents are fed up with people causing a ruckus and ignoring social distancing orders as people continue to die.

          While the government has mandated that people cut down on gathering, the number of loud house parties have risen in New York City, according 311 noise complaints. Reports of disruptive residential parties are usually higher during those the warmer months, however 2020 is breaking records.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          New Yorkers reported more than 12,000 loud music parties in March, up from 10,400 in 2019. In April, when the pandemic was in full affect, close to 16,000 loud parties were reported to city government, the highest in 10 years and up from 11,500 the year before.

          Kristi Welch, a student at BMCC and a Harlem resident, said she’s also noticed more strangers in her building.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “It could be because I’m home more often now,” Welch said. “But really, who wants random people visiting during this time?

          Bettie Miller, 45, said she noticed a similar trend in her South Bronx apartment building. Most of the people visiting seemed to be teenagers who would otherwise be in school, she said. 
          
          
      

        </p>
<p class="g-copy">“Clearly no one is listening to the rules," Bettie said. "And if they are listening, they sure aren't following them.""
